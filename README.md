# Skate or Cry

by Eddie chung @roosterhack

Game project

My game project is a side scroll skateboarding game, the goal of this game is to not hit any obstacles by jumping(ollie or kickflip) over the them. The longer the player last the more points the player collects.

This is my game that I built from scratch. I used p5 and play javascript libraries which utilise the HTML5 canvas to create animations and logic.

It was challenging, due to my design background, I had a particular visual look for the game but at the same time I had to work on the logic and interactions of the game. I spent a long time looking for the right images and sound assets. I had to do a lot of editing for the players animation.

If I have more time, I would like to improve the logic of the obstacles, add incentives and add more tricks for the skater. Better animation, ideally create all the graphics on my own. However, it was a great experience and I've learn a lot during this project. Respect to all the game makers out there!
